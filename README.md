A Project Website

This is a dynamic website i made as a final project in my last course.

I used a Bootstrap base template and customized the HTML and CSS files to meet my requirements. I used a WAMP server to local host the website and test all functionalities, Databases were created with PhPMyAdmin.

Several functions were added to the website, for example:
- Login and logout.
- Registration for new members.
- Access restriction to "Store" page for non members.
- Send message emails with the Contact Form using PhPMailer.
- Form validation with AJAX to check user inputs. Returns alert messages if the user is trying to send incorrect inputs.
- Responsiveness.
